# Data Science Professional Certificate - Final Projects

This repository contains the final projects for the "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate" available on Coursera. In the following, the descriptions of the many project scenarios.

## Tools for Data Science

In this final assignment, you will:

1. Create a Jupyter Notebook
2. Insert code and markdown cells
3. Share your notebook through GitHub

## Python Project for Data Science

For this project, you will assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. Your job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data you will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

### Dashboard Analytics Displayed

A dashboard often provides a view of key performance indicators in a clear way. Analyzing a data set and extracting key performance indicators will be practiced. Prompts will be used to support learning in accessing and displaying data in dashboards. Learning how to display key performance indicators on a dashboard will be included in this assignment. We will be using Plotly in this course for data visualization and is not a requirement to take this course.

In the Python for Data Science, AI and Development course you utilized Skills Network Labs for hands-on labs.

For this project you will use Skills Network Labs and Watson Studio. Skills Network Labs is a sandbox environment for learning and completing labs in courses. Whereas Watson Studio, a component of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is a suite of tools and a collaborative environment for data scientists, data analysts, AI and machine learning engineers and domain experts to develop and deploy your projects.

## Data Analysis with Python

In this assignment, you are a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. You are tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. You will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. A template notebook is provided in the lab; your job is to complete the ten questions. Some hints to the questions are given in the template notebook.

The dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It was taken from

# Data Science Professional Certificate - Final Projects

This repository contains some of the final projects for the "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate" available on Coursera. The repository focuses on the final labs implemented by Jupyter notebooks. In the following, the descriptions of the many project scenarios.

## Tools for Data Science

In this final assignment, you will:

1. Create a Jupyter Notebook
2. Insert code and markdown cells
3. Share your notebook through GitHub

## Python Project for Data Science

For this project, you will assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. Your job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data you will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

### Dashboard Analytics Displayed

A dashboard often provides a view of key performance indicators in a clear way. Analyzing a data set and extracting key performance indicators will be practiced. Prompts will be used to support learning in accessing and displaying data in dashboards. Learning how to display key performance indicators on a dashboard will be included in this assignment. We will be using Plotly in this course for data visualization and is not a requirement to take this course.

In the Python for Data Science, AI and Development course you utilized Skills Network Labs for hands-on labs.

For this project you will use Skills Network Labs and Watson Studio. Skills Network Labs is a sandbox environment for learning and completing labs in courses. Whereas Watson Studio, a component of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is a suite of tools and a collaborative environment for data scientists, data analysts, AI and machine learning engineers and domain experts to develop and deploy your projects.

## Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python

As a hands on Assignment, you will be working on a real world dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal. Imagine, you have been hired by a non-profit organization that strives to improve educational outcomes for children and youth in the City of Chicago. Your job is to analyze the census, crime, and school data for a given neighborhood or district. You will identify causes that impact the enrollment, safety, health, environment ratings of schools.

You will be asked questions that will help you understand the data just like a data analyst or data scientist would. You will be assessed both on the correctness of your SQL queries and results.

A Python based Jupyter notebook has been provided to help with completing this assignment. Follow the instructions to complete all the problems. Then share the Queries and Results with your peers for reviewing.

### Assignment Topic:
In this assignment, you will download the datasets provided, load them into a database, write and execute SQL queries to answer the problems provided, and upload a screenshot showing the correct SQL query and result for review by your peers. A Jupyter notebook is provided in the preceding lesson to help you with the process.

This assignment involves 3 datasets for the city of Chicago obtained from the Chicago Data Portal:

1. Chicago Socioeconomic Indicators. This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a hardship index, by Chicago community area, for the years 2008 â€“ 2012.

2. Chicago Public Schools. This dataset shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year.

3. Chicago Crime Data. This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days.

## Data Analysis with Python

In this assignment, you are a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. You are tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. You will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. A template notebook is provided in the lab; your job is to complete the ten questions. Some hints to the questions are given in the template notebook.

The dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It was taken from

It was also slightly modified for the purposes of the course. 

## Data Analysis with Python

This is Honors Project. Its completion is optional but highly recommended. For your project, you will use a rainfall dataset from Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data.
